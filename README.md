This project is an AI-powered Itinerary Planner built using CrewAI, a multi-agent framework that enables autonomous agents to collaborate and solve complex tasks. The planner intelligently generates personalized travel itineraries based on the user's preferences, dates, budget, and travel goals.

Powered by CrewAI agents, the system fetches relevant data, makes real-time decisions, and outputs a detailed, day-by-day travel plan.
